# üöÄ GitHub Action for creating Pull Requests
**GitHub Action that will create a pull request from the currently selected branch.**


## üì¶ Available on
- **Docker Hub:** [devopsinfra/action-pull-request:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/devopsinfra/action-pull-request)
- **GitHub Packages:** [ghcr.io/devops-infra/action-pull-request:latest](https://github.com/devops-infra/action-pull-request/pkgs/container/action-pull-request)


## ‚ú® Features
* Creates pull request if triggered from a current branch or any specified by `source_branch` to a `target_branch`
* Title and body of a pull request can be specified with `title` and `body`
* Can assign `assignee`, `reviewer`, one or more `label`, a `milestone` or mark it as a `draft`
* Can replace any `old_string` inside a pull request template with a `new_string`. Or put commits' subjects in place of `old_string`
* When `get_diff` is `true` will add list of commits in place of `<!-- Diff commits -->` and list of modified files in place of `<!-- Diff files -->` in a pull request template
* When `allow_no_diff` is set to true will continue execution and create pull request even if both branches have no differences, e.g. having only a merge commit
* Supports both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures

## üè∑Ô∏è Version Tags: vX, vX.Y, vX.Y.Z
This action supports three tag levels for flexible versioning:
- `vX`: latest patch of the major version (e.g., `v1`).
- `vX.Y`: latest patch of the minor version (e.g., `v1.2`).
- `vX.Y.Z`: fixed to a specific release (e.g., `v1.2.3`).

### ‚ûø How get_diff works
In previous versions occurrences of following strings in a template result with replacing them with list of commits and list of modified files (`<!-- Diff commits -->` and `<!-- Diff files -->`).

Now this action will expect to have three types of comment blocks. Meaning anything between `START` and `END` comment will get replaced. This is especially important when updating pull request with new commits.

* `<!-- Diff summary - START -->` and `<!-- Diff summary - END -->` - show first lines of each commit in the pull request
* `<!-- Diff commits - START -->` and `<!-- Diff commits - END -->` - show graph of commits in the pull request, with authors' info and time
* `<!-- Diff files - START -->` and `<!-- Diff files - END -->` - show list of modified files

If your template uses old comment strings it will try to adjust them in the pull request body to a new standard when pull request is created. It will not modify the template.

**CAUTION**: Remember to not use default `fetch-depth` for [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action. Rather set it to `0` - see example below.


## üíª Usage Examples

Red areas show fields that can be dynamically expanded based on commits to the current branch.
Blue areas show fields that can be set in action configuration.

![Example screenshot](https://github.com/devops-infra/action-pull-request/raw/master/action-pull-request.png)


### üìù Basic Example
Create pull request for non-master branches:

```yaml
name: Run the Action
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: master
jobs:
  action-pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Create pull request
        uses: devops-infra/action-pull-request@v1.0.2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          title: Automatic pull request
```

### üîÄ Advanced Example
Use first commit as a title and part of body, add a label based on a branch name, add git differences in the template:

```yaml
name: Run the Action
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: master
jobs:
  action-pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Run the Action
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/feature')
        uses: devops-infra/action-pull-request@v1.0.2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          title: ${{ github.event.commits[0].message }}
          assignee: ${{ github.actor }}
          label: automatic,feature
          template: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/FEATURE.md
          old_string: "**Write your description here**"
          new_string: ${{ github.event.commits[0].message }}
          get_diff: true
```

### üéØ Use specific version
Run the Action with a specific version tag.

```yaml
name: Run the Action
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: master
jobs:
  action-pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - uses: devops-infra/action-pull-request@v1.0.2
        id: Pin patch version

      - uses: devops-infra/action-pull-request@v1.0
        id: Pin minor version

      - uses: devops-infra/action-pull-request@v1
        id: Pin major version
```
